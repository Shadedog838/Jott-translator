This file contains provided code, testers, and test cases.

provided should be a top level package in your src directory
JottParserTester and JottTokenizerTester classes should be in a package call testers.

the testCases directories should be in the working directory of your project.

Update Phase 1:
To run the project first compile the JottTokenizer, TokenType and the Token class.
We have all our code in the JottTokenizer.java file. Use the JottTokenizerTester in the testers folder to test.

Update Phase 2:
To run project compile all classes in provided folder, many new node classes have been added. Then use JottParserTester in the testers folder to test.

Update Phase 3:
To run project compile Jott.java file with "javac Jott.java", and then run "java Jott <input-jott-file>, <output-file>, <output-language>". The only output-language implemented is currently Jott.

Update Phase 4:
To run project compile Jott.java file with "javac Jott.java", and then run "java Jott <input-jott-file>, <output-file>, <output-language>". The output-language field can now be Jott, C, Java, or Python.  convertToC.h will be created when converting Jott to C.
